    That's the wrapper for your presentation steps. In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    It doesn't have to be a `<div>`. Only `id` is important here as that's how the script find it.
    
    It's worth to notice the `impress-not-supported` class. This class means, that browser doesn't
    support features required by impress.js, so you can apply some fallback styles in your CSS.
    It's not necessary to add it manually on this element. If the script detects that browser is not
    good enough it will add this class, but keeping it in HTML means that users without JavaScript
    will also get fallback styles.
    
    The class name on this element also depends on currently active presentation step. More details about
    it can be found below, when `hint` element is being described.
    
-->
<div id="impress" class="impress-not-supported">

    <div class="fallback-message">
        <p>Your browser <b>doesn't support the features required</b> for this presentation, so you are presented with a simplified version.</p>
        <p>For the best experience please use the latest <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Safari</b> or <b>Firefox</b> browser. Upcoming version 10 of Internet Explorer <i>should</i> also handle it. If you have an iPad, give that a try too.</p>
    </div>

        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data attributes. So to make a summary of all the 
		possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:

		* `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` -- they define the position of **the center** of step element on
		    the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
		* `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` -- they define the rotation of
		    the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
		    are exactly the same;
		* `data-scale` -- defines the scale of step element; default value is 1

		The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
		If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.

		The hash part of the url when this step is active will be `#/step-2`.

		You can also use `#step-2` in a link, to point directly to this particular step.

		Please note, that while `#/step-2` (with slash) would also work in a link it's not recommended.
		Using classic `id`-based links like `#step-2` makes these links usable also in fallback mode.

    To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
    I strongly encourage to minify it first.
    
    You also need to call a `impress()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
    And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
    because I should be done when the whole document is ready.
    Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was to lazy to do so ;)
    
-->
<script src="js/impress.js"></script>
<script>impress();</script>
<script src="js/raphael-min.js"></script>
<script src="js/drawing.js"></script>

<!--
    
    The `impress()` function also gives you access to API to control the presentation.
    
    Just store the result of the call:
    
        var api = impress();
    
    and you will get three functions you can call:
    
        `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,
        `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation
        `api.goto( stepElement ) - moves the presentation to given step element (the DOM element of the step).
    
    You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.
    Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.
    
    For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API
    is used in event handlers.
